#X text 33 19 AUDIO BLOCK:;
#X text 33 44 For the CPU to not compute every sample one at a time
\, audio signals are usually processed in chucks \, or in a "block".
This is also called the vector or buffer size \, and can be specified
in number of samples or in ms. The standard in Pd is a block of 64
samples! The [blocksize~] object from ELSE reports the current block
size in the patch.;
#X text 29 215 LATENCY:;
#X text 32 235 Latency is the time it takes for an audio process to
come out. Within any audio application \, the latency depends mostly
on the block size and sample rate. The 64 block size then can represent
a lower latency if the sample rate is higher. At 44.1 Khz \, this is
about 1.45 ms \, but a sample rate of 88.2 khz would be half of that.
See below how the [blocksize~] object can also report the block size
in ms and how to calculate that as we've seen before.;
#X text 197 381 click =>;
#X text 123 459 block latency in ms;
#X text 33 508 the block size is always 64 samples for [adc~] and [dac~]
\, but we can change the block size with the native [block~] object.
Despite being redundant \, we have this object below setting a block
size of 64;
#X text 103 585 standard block size:;
#X text 497 123 In this tutorial we use [block~] to perform one sample
feedbacks and to perform FFT analysis. The [block~] object can also
locally change the sample rate and we'll see this in a bit., f 63
;
#X text 497 187 The [switch~] object has the same functions as [block~]
but can also turn the audio process on or off locally \, just for the
patch window it's contained in \, so this can be the whole patch or
just a subptch! This is useful because audio objects will consume CPU
power whenever the DSP is on \, so we can save a little when we're
not using a patch or subpatch that is opened., f 63;
#X text 497 283 One way to check the block size is with the [prnit~]
object \, which prints the whole block size in Pd's terminal window
when it receives a bang. Check it below., f 63;
#X text 506 430 See also [print] \, the control version of this object.
To reinforce the difference between audio and control objects \, not
how the [print] object prints ininterruptly when requested \, but [print~]
only operates when the DSP is on., f 63;

sample! sthe [blocksize~] object confirms and reports thatjust for
illustration., f 48;

#X text 240 125 Now when you bang [print~] \, you can see how it only
prints one single value instead of 64 as it's the case with the parent

samples is usually done in a subpatch \, altering the block size only
in that subwindow. One reason to do this is not to have conflicts with
[adc~] and [dac~] objects in the patch's main window., f 62;
