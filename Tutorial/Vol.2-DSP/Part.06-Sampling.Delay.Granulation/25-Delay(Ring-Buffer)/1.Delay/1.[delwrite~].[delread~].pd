#X text 104 124 The native [delwrite~] object creates a "ring buffer"
\, which is a buffer to continuously record to. You can think of a
magnetic tape in a loop \, so when you record the whole length of the
tape you start recording again from the beggining. This was how the
first delays were designed \, by the way. One head was used to write
and another to read at different length points (the further back \,
the bigger the delay)., f 55;
#X text 104 245 The native [delread~] object \, when named with the
same delay line \, can access the buffer at different length points
(set in ms with the second argument or inlet). Multiple [delread~]
objects can read from the same line defined in [delwrite~]., f 55

#X text 104 55 The "delay" is the basis of many processes and FX as
we'll see throughout this tutorial \, such as flanger \, chorus \,
echo and reverberation effects \, pitch shifters and also how they
are the basis of filters., f 55;
