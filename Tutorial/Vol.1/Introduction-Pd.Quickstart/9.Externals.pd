#X text 418 294 For single binaries \, as is the case with else \,
you can also use "namespaces" \, this means loading the external by
setting a relative path \, such as:;
#X obj 619 338 else/fbdelay~;
#X text 419 377 This will only work if the folder containing the external
library is included in a folder that Pd automatically searches for
files \, as is the case with Pd's externals folder \, the usual folder
for externals in Pd., f 59;

#X text 419 167 Here's how to use [declare] to load objects from the
ELSE library. If the objects don't show is because you haven't downloaded
it yet. Download and reload the patch so you can instantiate [sine~]
and [pluck~].;
#X text 418 449 In techical terms \, an external is any object not
part of Pd's binary. Pd Vanilla itself includes extra objects that
are technically externals and they're included in a folder called "extra"
inside Pd's application \, which is searched automatically. One example
is the [sigmund~] object. Abstractions are also externals and Pd also
provides some of those in the "extra" folder \, like the reverb objects
below.;
#X text 28 194 In "Help => Find Externals" there's a preference tabs
where you can opt to be prompted you if you want to add a downloaded
library to your path (which is good \, since sometimes you don't really
want that \, like when it's a single binary pack., f 49;
#X text 28 333 The order of the user added paths matter \, where the
search is prioritized to the first paths. You may have many installed
libraries where different eternals have the same name. Using [declare]
forces a priority over the user added paths and casn help you control
that., f 49;
#X text 28 15 Pd can install many externals via the "Help => Find Externals"
menu. Just search for an external or library name (like "else") and
get it. These get usually downloaded to Pd's externals folder and need
to be loaded properly., f 49;
#X text 28 91 Compiled external libraries come either as a single binary
pack (the "classic" library format) or as a set of separate binaries.
The first case needs to be loaded in Pd's startup (Preferences => Startup)
and the second only needs you to add the library's folder to the user
added search paths (in Preferences => Path)., f 49;
#X text 28 270 Rhe [declare] object is an alternative to load both
kinds of libraries. But it loads them just for the patch containing
it \, unlike adding to the Path/Statup (that permanently installs it).
, f 49;
#X text 28 425 If you haven't \, please download the "else" library
\, which is needed for this tutorial and widely used from this point
forward. Just go to "Help => Find Externals" and search for 'else'.
It comes with separate binaries. In this tutorial we use the declare
object so you don't need to add it to the user search paths., f 49
