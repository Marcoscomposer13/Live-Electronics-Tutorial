This is a didactic project developed for Pure Data (or just "Pd", a.k.a. "Pd vanilla" distribution). It was developed for version 0.48-2 and should work on later versionsÂ­ - download Pd at <http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html>. The example patches only work for Pd Vanilla and are not compatible to other distributions (such as Pd-Extended / Purr Data). They also rely heavily on the download of the "ELSE" library. You can download it directly via Pd, just go for Help => Find Externals and search for 'else' - check: <https://github.com/porres/pd-else/> for more details. Also Access <http://puredata.info> for several links/tutoriais on Pd. The official Pd mailing list is found here: <http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pdlist>. 

This work started in 2008 as a textbook for a computer music course. In 2009, the author presented a paper about it in the 3rd International Pure Data Convention. Currently, the work is divided in two volumes and solely presented as example patches that the author uses for courses and workshops. The plan now is to write a book accompanied by these examples. Originally developed in brazilian portuguese, this is the first translation to english and only contains patches from vol. 1. 

This is just a first draft from the first translation round. Many typos and mistakes may exist. This work is also being rewritten from scratch and expanded to include objects from the ELSE library, and since this library is still at a beta and early stage of development, much of this work now relies on the development of ELSE.

This tutorial presents electronic music theory and practice for newbies, dummies, enthusiasts and also experts, without prerequisits. The choice of using Pure Data is its accessibility and also because it is considered a powerful didactic tool to present the topics of the Live Electronics / Computer Music tutorial.
