Live Electronic Music Tutorial with examples in Pure Data and the ELSE Library
By Alexandre Torres Porres (porres@gmail.com) 

This tutorial presents theory and practice of Live Electronics topics without prerequisits. It's aimed at newbies, dummies, enthusiasts and also experts. Pure Data is adopted  in the examples for its accessibility and for being a powerful didactic tool. Nonetheless, this work relies heavily in the ELSE library for Pure Data, also developed by the author of this tutorial: Alexandre Torres Porres.

   This is a didactic project developed with Pure Data (or just "Pd", a.k.a. "Pd vanilla" distribution), an open source software developed by Miller Puckette - get it at <http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html>. Also Access <http://puredata.info> for other resources on Pd. The official Pd mailing list is found here: <http://lists.puredata.info/listinfo/pdlist>. 
   
   
   This project started in 2008 as a textbook for a computer music course. In 2009, the author presented a paper about it in the 3rd International Pure Data Convention. Currently, the work is divided into two volumes and solely presented as example patches that the author uses in his courses/workshops. The plan now is to write a book accompanied by these examples. Originally developed in brazilian portuguese and relying on Pd Extended 0.42-5 for years, this has just been rewritten from scratch in english and ported to rely only in objects from the ELSE external library and the newer Pd Vanilla versions.
   
   This is still in the early drafts from the first translation round, so many typos and mistakes may exist. This work is now depending on the software development of the ELSE library to include more examples. Since the ELSE library is still in an early beta stage of development, some objects may change in functionality, new objects are being developed and others might even be deleted until a final version is out. If so, future updates of this didactc material will reflect these changes.  

There are plans to include more topics and examples in this tutorial, which can furtherly be split into 3 volumes.
