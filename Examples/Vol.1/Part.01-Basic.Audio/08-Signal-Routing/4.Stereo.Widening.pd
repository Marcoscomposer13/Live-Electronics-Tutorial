#X text 27 42 Stereo widening is any technique that increases the perceived
stereo width or spread of a signal into the stereo field. Panning is
one scuch technique \, but this example shows you other cheap and dirt
tricks to create stereo images from mono sources., f 61;
#X text 27 120 But first let's understand how we listen. We have two
ears pointed to opposite direction. Our brain can perceive when a sound
source reaches both of our ears \, and the delay from when it arrives
to one ear and the other gives us a cue on where the sound source is
located. A good stereo microphone recording places the microphones
in a way to achieve this imaging effect., f 61;

#X text 27 258 This delay trick is also known as the "Hass effect"
\, and we can implement it by simply duplicating a mono signal but
delaying one of the outputs. Try delay values from 7 to 21 ms as in
the example below \, which is a good range for the haas effect (but
you could go wilder than that if you want \, right? Why not?)., f

#X text 486 71 While we're on the subject \, if you have a stereo track
that you sum together into a mono source \, you can have cancelling
issues. One way out is to invert or flip the polarity of one of the
tracks. This is just multiplying by -1 and deals with cancelling issues.
, f 55;
#X text 485 148 Conversely \, we can also get one mono input and create
a widened stereo effect by inverting the polarity of one of the tracks.
See the difference below., f 55;
