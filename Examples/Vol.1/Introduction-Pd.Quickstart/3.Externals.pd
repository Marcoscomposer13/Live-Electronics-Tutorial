#X text 26 16 Techically \, an external is any object not part of Pd's
binary. Pd Vanilla itself includes some in a folder called "extra"
inside its application \, which is searched automatically. One example
is the [sigmund~] object. Abstractions are also externals and Pd also
has some of those in the "extra" library \, like the reverb objects
below., f 50;
#X text 28 195 Via the "Help => Find Externals" menu \, you can use
Pd's externals manager (a.k.a the 'Deken' plgin) to search for an external
or library name (such as "else") and download it. It's usual to download
them to Pd's externals folder., f 49;
#X text 29 275 Compiled external libraries come either as a single
binary pack (the "classic" library format) or as a set of separate
binaries. Single binary packs need to be loaded via the startup tab
(Preferences => Startup) and the second type only needs you to add
the library's folder to the search paths (in Preferences => Path).
'Deken' has a preference tabs where you can opt to be prompted you
if you want to add a library to the paths after it's downloaded (sometimes
you don't want it \, like when it's a single binary pack)., f 49;
#X text 29 436 The [declare] object is an alternative to load both
kinds of libraries. But it loads them just for the patch containing
it \, unlike adding to the Path/Statup (which installs permanently).
, f 49;
#X text 29 499 The order of the user added paths matter \, as the search
is prioritized to the first ones. You may have many installed libraries
where different externals can have the same name. Using [declare] forces
a priority over the user added paths and can help you control that.
, f 49;
#X text 29 591 If you haven't \, please download the "ELSE" library
\, which is needed for this tutorial and widely used from this point
forward. You can use 'deken' for it., f 49;
#X text 418 365 ELSE comes with separate binaries \, so you need to
load it with the -path flag in [declare]. this tutorial uses the declare
object in all examples \, so you don't need to add else's folder it
to the user search paths., f 58;
#X text 418 438 For single binaries \, as is the case with else \,
you could alternatively use relative paths \, such as:, f 58;
#X text 496 95 <= Tutorial's Readme, f 13;
#X text 682 94 <= ELSE's repository, f 14;
#X text 410 15 Make sure to download the right version of ELSE for
this tutorial. You can find this information on this tutorial's readme.
Check also ELSE's repository on github. Click on the bang buttons below
to open them., f 57;
#X text 419 596 For more information on how Pd handles externals \,
check section 4 of Pd's manual in the browser. In Window => Help Browser
go to (Pure Data/1.manual/x4.htm).;
#X text 417 236 If no objects below are shown \, then you hadn't downloaded
ELSE when you opened this patch. So download it and reload the patch
so you can instantiate [sine~] and [pluck~]. Here's how to use [declare]
to load it.;
#X text 416 179 Note you can also download and install else direclty
from its repository (which contains all previous verions) manually.
