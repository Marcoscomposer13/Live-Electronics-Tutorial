#X text 29 499 The order of the user added paths matter \, as the search
is prioritized to the first ones. You may have many installed libraries
where different externals can have the same name. Using [declare] forces
a priority over the user added paths and can help you control that.

#X text 417 236 If no objects below are shown \, then you hadn't downloaded
ELSE when you opened this patch. So download it and reload the patch
so you can instantiate [sine~] and [pluck~]. Here's how to use [declare]
to load it.;
#X text 416 179 Note you can also download and install else direclty
from its repository (which contains all previous verions) manually.
;
#X text 26 16 Techically \, an external is any object not part of Pd's
binary. Pd Vanilla itself includes some in a folder called "extra"
(a.k.a the "extra library") inside its application \, searched automatically.
One example is the [sigmund~] object. Abstractions are also externals
and Pd also has some of those in the "extra" library \, like the reverb
objects below., f 51;
#X text 28 195 Via the "Help => Find Externals" menu \, you can use
Pd's externals manager (a.k.a the 'Deken' plugin) to search for an
external or library name (such as "else") and download it. It's usual
to download them to Pd's externals folder., f 49;
#X text 29 275 Compiled external libraries come either as a single
binary pack (the "classic" library format) or as a set of separate
binaries. Single binary packs need to be loaded via the startup tab
(Preferences => Startup) and the second type only needs you to add
the library's folder to the search paths (in Preferences => Path).
'Deken' has a preference tabs where you can opt to be prompted if you
want to add a library to the paths after it's downloaded (sometimes
you don't want it \, like when it's a single binary pack)., f 49;
#X text 29 436 The [declare] object is an alternative to load both
kinds of libraries. But it loads them just for the patch containing
it \, unlike adding to the Path/Statup (which installs permanently).

#X obj 462 322 declare -lib else;
#X text 29 591 If you haven't already \, please download the "ELSE"
library that is needed for this tutorial and widely used from this
point onward. You can use 'deken' for it., f 49;
#X text 410 15 Actually \, installing the ELSE library already dowloads
this tutorial and this is what you should have done. You can find installing
information on this tutorial's readme. Check also ELSE's repository
on github. Click on the bang buttons below to open them.;
#X text 418 365 ELSE comes with separate binaries \, so you could add
else's folder to the user added search paths. Nonetheless \, you should
use [declare -lib] \, which loads the path and shows the version information.
This tutorial uses [declare] in all examples.;
#X text 418 443 But in the end \, since you just have single binaries
or abstractions in the ELSE library \, you could alternatively use
relative paths \, such as:;
