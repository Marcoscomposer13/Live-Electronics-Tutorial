#X text 32 28 The audio input/output objects in Pd are \, respectively
\, [adc~] (from "Analog to Digital Converter") and [dac~] (from "Digital
to Analog Converter")., f 55;
#X text 196 90 audio input;
#X text 32 166 The names indicate that Pd considers itself as a digital
audio station \, which is nothing but true \, but also indicates that
whatever incoming and outcoming audio is analog \, which is not necessarily
true., f 56;
#X text 31 340 By default \, [adc~] and [dac~] deal with stereo in/out
\, which are numbered as "1" and "2" \, but you can define other channels
with the arguments., f 56;

#X text 490 391 Note that the [out~] object automatically turns the
DSP On when dragging the slider \, and that it has a toggle for turning
the DSP On and Off. The [setdsp~] object from ELSE may also turn the
audio on and off with a toggle so audio objects can operate. It also
force the audio to be turned on or off when we open the patch. Check
its help file and also check [out2~] for stereo input., f 58;
#X text 32 232 The fact is that these objects communicate with audio
drivers and sound cards in your audio configurations \, so it then
depends on whether it has analog and/or digital in/outputs and how
many of them. Most audio cards will have analog in/outs and it's in
the audio card that the Analog x Digital conversion actually takes
place \, not in Pd., f 56;
#X text 470 45 The ELSE library \, that you were told to install in
the last example (so you should have it already) \, contains the [out~]
object \, which is in fact an abstraction (a Pd patch) that includes
[dac~]. This is just for convenience and uses the default stereo output
configuration (output channels 1 and 2). Check its help file., f 61

with an audio sound card connected to speakers \, you should hear the
