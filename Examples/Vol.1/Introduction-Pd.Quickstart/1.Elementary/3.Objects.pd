#X text 70 23 In Pd we have two types of objects:;
#X text 85 44 - Audio objects, f 21;
#X text 84 58 - Control objects;
#X text 67 95 Audio objects deal \, in some way \, with audio signals.
In the vast majority of cases \, it will have at least one signal input
or output. Audio objects end with a tilde sign (~) \, which resembles
a cute and little sinusoidal wave., f 53;
#X text 52 334 On the other hand \, control objects aren't capable
of dealing with audio signals at all and do not end with "~". Hence
\, they can only accept and generate control messages \, such as coming
from message or number boxes \, for example.;
#X text 111 422 message box =>;
#X text 316 421 <= number box;
#X text 86 454 control objects =>;
#X text 530 20 A great difference between audio signals and control
messages is that control data is processed any time in Pd as requested.
But audio signals need to have the "DSP" engine on \, and they consume
CPU power even if they aren't connected to anything!, f 62;
#X text 68 180 Example of audio objects:;
#X obj 157 266 line~;
#X text 200 266 <= generate signal lines;
#X obj 157 293 dac~;
#X text 200 293 <= audio output;
#X obj 157 212 *~;
#X text 200 213 <= audio multiplication;
#X obj 157 238 osc~;
#X text 200 239 <= oscillator;
#X text 530 90 By default \, the DSP (from "digital signal processing")
is off when we open Pd. Therefore \, no audio object is operational
\, but control objects are. The DSP can be turned on and off in the
terminal window \, via the Menu (Media => DSP On / Dsp Off) and its
shortcuts. It's also possible to send a message to Pd as we'll see
later., f 62;
#X obj 612 285 osc~ 440;
#X obj 223 454 * 5;
#X obj 276 453 + 5;
#X text 57 520 Objects usually take arguments \, which are default
values. Above we have the argument of '5' for both objects \, so the
incoming value gets multipliued by '5' in the [*] object and summed
by '5' in the [+] object.;
#X text 687 286 <= argument \, frequency of 440 Hz;
#X obj 614 456 *~;
#X obj 615 518 dac~;
#X obj 660 415 line~;

#X text 718 341 generate a line to 1 in 1000 ms;
#X text 733 378 generate a line to 0 in 1000 ms;
#X text 533 195 With the DSP On \, let's take a look at this simple
patch that controls the volume of an oscillator for a fade in/out.
