#X text 507 71 We use a ratio value to set the speed \, this can also
be set as a percentage value or in cents. All you need is to multiply
the ratio by the frequency in hertz. Note that negative percentage/ratio
values plays the file backwards., f 58;
#X text 507 141 We need to multiply the output of [phasor~] by the
number of samples in the file so we can access the indexes from the
array., f 58;
#X text 35 21 If you want to play a sound file at different speeds
or even backwards \, you need objects that perform interpolation such
as the native [tabread4~] object or [table~] from ELSE., f 61;
#X text 36 71 With them you can then set any reading speed (such as
1.5x) which means the reading point will fall in between samples \,
hence you need to interpolate. We'll see the interpolation type of
[tabread4~] a bit later., f 61;
#X text 37 139 These objects also allow you to play files with a different
sample rate than Pd is running \, because since you can play the file
at different speeds \, you can also compensate the difference.;

#X text 374 558 Interpolation can add noise artifacts. To reduce this
error you can work with files with higher sample rates than Pd is running
\, such as 88.2 KHz sound file when running at 44.1 Khz as in this
example., f 50;
#X text 374 633 You can use a good resampling software to upsample
a sound file as was done here for this example., f 50;

#X text 37 210 In this example we use [phasor~] to read from [tabread4~].
The [phasor~] object is used to play the sample in a loop \, and we
need to find the frequency corresponding to the sound file's period.
We do that by dividing the sample rate of the file (even if it's different
than Pd's) by the number of samples - both information are given by
[sample~] (one could use [soundfiler] instead \, in which [sample~]
is based on)., f 61;
