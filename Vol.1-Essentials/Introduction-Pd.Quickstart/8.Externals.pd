#X text 38 121 There are two types of external libraries \, they either
come compiled in a single binary pack or each object comes as a separate
binary. The first case is the classic library format and needs to be
loaded in Pd's startup (Preferences => Startup). The second case doesn't
need any of that but you need to add the library's folder to the search
paths (Preferences => Path)., f 49;
#X obj 660 261 sine~;
#X obj 610 580 rev1~;
#X obj 663 580 rev2~, f 8;
#X obj 737 580 rev3~, f 8;
#X obj 733 261 pluck~;
#X text 425 303 For single binaries \, as is the case with else \,
you can also use "namespaces" \, this means loading the external by
setting a relative path \, such as:;
#X obj 626 347 else/fbdelay~;
#X text 38 28 You can download and install many externals directly
from the "Help => Find Externals" menu. Just search for the name of
an external or external library ("else" \, for example) and get it.
Externals get usually downloaded to Pd's externals folder and need
to be loaded properly., f 49;
#X text 38 348 A different method is to use the [declare] object to
load both kinds of libraries with the "-lib" and "-path" flags. This
loads the libraries just for the patch containing the [declare] object.
Hence \, adding to the Path or Statup installs permanently and you
can use in any patch., f 49;
#X text 425 386 This will only work if the folder containing the external
library is included in a folder that Pd automatically searches for
files \, as is the case with Pd's externals folder \, the usual folder
for externals in Pd., f 59;
#X obj 504 581 sigmund~;
#X text 425 458 In techical terms \, an external is any object not
part of Pd's binary. Pd Vanilla itself includes extra objects that
are technically externals and they're included in a folder called "extra"
inside Pd's application \, which is searched automatically. One example
is the [sigmund~] object. Abstractions are also externals and Pd also
provides some of those in the "extra" folder \, like the reverb objects.

#X text 38 243 In "Help => Find Externals" there's a preference tabs
where you can click on an option to prompt you if you want to add a
downloaded library to your path. You can also have it always add whatever
you download to yout path. But sometimes you don't want to do that
\, like when you actually want to load a binary via startup., f 49
;
#X text 38 439 The order of the added paths matter. The search is prioritized
to the first paths. If nothing is found \, then it moves to the next
paths. In the case you have many installed libraries \, you can have
different objects with the same name \, so you want to be sure to load
the right one. Hence \, even if you have added a library's path. There's
an advantage of using [declare] \, because it'll force a priority to
the path declared (or to the first path if you declare more than one)
\, so you can control and make sure to load the right objects., f

#X obj 496 261 declare -path else;
#X text 426 28 If you haven't \, please download "else" \, which is
needed for this tutorial and widely used from this point forward. It's
a library that comes with separate binaries \, so it must be added
to the search paths. Just go to "Help => Find Externals" and search
for 'else'.;
#X text 426 107 Make sure to download the right version of ELSE for
this tutorial. Note you can also manually download and install else
from all the available versions in its repository. Check the readme
of this tutorial for more information.;
#X text 426 176 Here's how to use [declare] to load objects from the
ELSE library. If the objects don't show is because youhaven't downloaded
it yet. Download and reload the patch so you can instantiate [sine~]
and [pluck~].;
